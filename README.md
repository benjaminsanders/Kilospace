###1. Preface

In early 2013 I decided I wanted to develop some form of browser based game, however my skills were lacking. After roughly two years of honing my skills I believe I am experienced enough to start development, and I'm sure I'll have much more to learn along the way. 

This is a personal project of mine to help me further refine my skills, so please don't rely on constant updates or daily logins to answer questions. I'll be posting the changes here so you can view the progress and changes being made to the site.

Of course, these will also be featured on the forum, which I'll link when it becomes avaiable.

###2. About

This section is a little hard to write right now, since I'm still developing the theme and story of the game.
